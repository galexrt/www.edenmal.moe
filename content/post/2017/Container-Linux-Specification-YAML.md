I checked the Container Linux configuration page and found the config specification here: https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/configuration.html (link refers to the latest version, the current version can be seen in the below field).
But it was presented as a HTML list, which I thought is bad and took it upon me to create a YAML version from it for easy use.

> **CURRENT VERSION** `1451.2.0`

The result can be found on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/galexrt/198b2738585b3000092ac3d1382fcfc3) or simply below in the embeded Gist:

Have Fun!

P.S. I try my best to keep it up to date. If you should notice it being outdated, please let me know by comment or email. Thanks!
