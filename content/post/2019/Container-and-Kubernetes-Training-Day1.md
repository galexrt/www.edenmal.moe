## Welcome!

Quick short introduction to myself, my name is Alexander Trost. Iâ€™m a sysadmin who loves automation, containers, coding in Go, playing games but also with new technologies.
I'm currently working at Cloudical as a DevOps Engineer, helping companies move to the cloud and / or to container technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, etc).

## Goal of the Training

The training is going to show how simple it is to get started with containers. In this case [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used, as it is the most popular container toolchain and runtime right now.
After getting to know containers and Docker, we will hopefully realize that there is a need for some kind of _magical_ orchestration layer to run applications and more in containers (in an orchestrated way). The important if you haven't noticed here is the orchestration of containers in an automated and orchestrated manner.

## README

If you have any questions or something is unclear during the workshop, please do not hesistate to ask.

{{< figure src="RTFM.png" width="450px" title="RTFM before asking, thanks!" >}}

Please before asking though make sure you have read the whole question, task and / or comment, thanks!

Now get ready for day #1 of the training!

### Heads up - "Blogger" Words

* **Grey Boxes**: Mostly contain an useful tip, expected command output or something funny.
* **TASK**: Is a refer to a task in the workshop repository.
* **WDWD**: Stands for "What does what do" aka "Me explaining what the things listed below do" (short forms FTW!). I only explain new things in these sections.
* **TL;DR**: **Too** **L**ong **D**idn't **R**ead.

### ["What's in the f*cking box?!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOkLPjaVK_w)

The VMs you are given for the training are running Fedora 29 (with Cockpit enabled).
Cockpit is a simple web management, which allows me to "monitor" the VMs and help, if a problem occurs.
Also to note `firewalld` has been stopped, disabled and removed, `iptables` and `ip6tables` have been cleared and rule persistence disabled.

#### Why are the VMs running Fedora?

That's simple. Fedora is more up to date, not e.g., like Debian :P

More "up to date" may not mean more stable (for "classical" / legacy applications) but having the latest kernel and other important applications, programs and libraries in their latest versions just makes it easier to run containers.
(Most applications, programs and libraries are available in their latest version from Fedora repositories, meaning that we do not need to begin building and / or downloading binares for applications, programs and libraries which is nice)

## Goal of the Day

We are going to learn what containers are, why they have gained so much popularity and what use cases for container there are. After everyone is on the same page of what a container is, we are going to look at Docker, as it is the most common container runtime.
We will look at running and managing containers, and building container images with Docker. `docker-compose` will also be shown, to demonstrate the simplicity of containers for multi container applications.
This will allow everyone to manage Docker containers and build their own application container images. With that we are ready to dive into enterprise container orchestration with Kubernetes on the next day.

## Container and Microservices

### Why do people like the "Docker way"?

The "Docker way" is basically just a way to package applications but also simplicity to run the containerized applications. Making it as simple as possible to for example starting a WordPress with database server with only two commands (or one command using `docker-compose`).
Simpleness that almost everybody, with even very little knowledge about using a shell or cmd, could do it. That's what makes Docker great but also opens a "dark" side.
The "dark" side being that those people and for example open issues, because they are unable to do basic debugging of an issue on their own and / or **R**ead**T**he**F**ucking**M**anual.

Still overall Docker is a good tool, which started the whole "container" hype.
Thanks to that, all the awesome open source applications using containers, like [Open Container Initiative](https://github.com/opencontainers), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) and many many more.

### Micro-what? Microservices!

Microservices are small gears of a big application.
As an example if you have an application which can show the weather, time and stores the per user timezone, one can imagine the following microservices:

* Weather Service
* Time Service
* User Timezone Profile Service
* Database

If for example you have many people access the weather service, you could go ahead and scale up / down that single service as needed to accomplish the load.

A MariaDB database, NoSQL database, Redis, etc, can also be seenfor a big application like, e.g., GitLab, WordPress, Magento, PrestaShop, etc.

Due to containers being smaller than VMs developers can test locally with ease and containers are and should be ephemeral. You should never have a problem with a container being deleted and / or recreated because for example you would lose data.
But obviously there is also a plus point for production, if Microservices are done right. When done right, it will allow to scale an application with ease at the pain points.

Meaning, e.g., that if the database is overloaded you would be able to scale it .

### Container? Container!

Currently Docker containers can (and will) only allow you to run any distribution that runs on Linux. NO WINDOWS or other bullshit!
Every container runs in it's own namespace. For this we need to understand how namespaces work.
A namespace is a separated "branch", where processes, mounts, etc. can exist without disturbing other processes, mounts, etc. in other namespaces.

An advantage of namespaces is, that you can limit the cpu, memory, network, etc. for them. For example, a process that goes rogue, can be limited to specific resource limits.

This diagram should make it clear, how namespaces can create "unlimited" separated and isolated container environments.

Docker and most other containers utilities use namespaces to separate containers from each other. There are several other techniques for kernel namespace separation to further improve security.

A container uses the running Linux kernel of the host, that is why there are less resources used, because a container is just using the existing kernel processes and doesn't need to spawn processes like that like when using a virtual machine.

Why is it a good idea to use separate namespaces for networked applications? Because if someone breaches for example your webserver, he is just in the container and not on the host server. If you'll then detect the breach, you just stop the container and would restart it with an updated image version that contains the latest webserver software.

> **TL;DR**
>
> A container is NOT a VM. A container is a "separate" namespace in the container of the host and not like a VM where everything is virtualized for the system, which can then be controlled.

## Prepare for the Docker Madness

> **NOTE**
>
> These steps only need to be exeucted the VM which has `master` in its name, not the other machines.

### Side Notes

* You can also install Docker on your system or in a VirtualBox. If you use a VirtualBox, please consider using Fedora 29 or anyother linux distro with at least kernel 4.x.
* If you are a Windows or Mac OSX user, switch to linux m8, thanks! Just kidding, there are ways like [Boot2Docker](http://boot2docker.io/) to run Docker "there" (I don't help or give any support if you use it though!).
* The download and login details to the VMs will be given to you.

### Docker System Requirements

{{< figure src="system-requirements-too-damn-high.png" width="325px" title="The System Requirements are too damn high - Meme" >}}

**Nope, they're not! :-D**

* A Linux-based distribution
* Linux Kernel `4.x+`
    * If you are on a RHEL based distribution, the `3.x` should also work though a more up to date kernel is preferred.

You can run Docker under any kernel `3.16+`, but I recommend you to use a more up to date kernel for the implemented improvements in some of the file system and network systems Docker uses.

### Docker Installation

To install Docker run the command:

```console
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ -o install-docker.sh
# Look at the install-docker.sh script to make sure there is nothing evil going on
sh install-docker.sh
```

For more details on the installation of Docker, please refer to the Docker documentation Linux installation [docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and select the distribution in the navigation sidebar, or the Windows installation [docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).

Docker consistst of the client program `docker` and the Docker Daemon (`dockerd`). To keep it simple "that is it", but there is more behind Docker.

After you have installed it hopefully without any errors popping up, you have to enable and start the Docker Engine:

```console
systemctl enable docker.service
systemctl start docker.service
```

This enables and starts the Docker daemon service.

To make sure the Docker daemon is working as expected, run `docker info`:

```console
$ docker info

After making sure Docker is working correctly, continue with either [Non-Root User section](#non-root-user) when you accessing the server as a non-root user or directly to the next section, [`docker-compose` Installation](#docker-compose-installation).

#### Non-Root User

If you are connected as a non-root user, you need to add your user to the `docker` group. The group name may vary depending on the distribution used.
To add your user to the `docker` group, you can run the following command:

```console
gpasswd -a $USER docker
```

Please logout from the server, after you have added yourself to the group.

> **NOTE**
>
> If you are persistent control connections for SSH, you need to terminate those connections as well when you are logged in as the user you just added to the Docker group.

### `docker-compose` Installation

{{< figure src="docker-compose-logo.png" width="225px" title="docker-compose Logo" >}}

With curl we download the `docker-compose` binary, then we move `docker-compose` to your `/usr/local/bin` that is in your `PATH` and set the execute permission.

```console
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                               Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   617    0   617    0     0   1226      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1226
100 15.4M  100 15.4M    0     0  5751k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:-- 7099k
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

For more detailed `docker-compose` installation instructions, see [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After you have followed the commands above, you can check if the "install" was successfully by running `docker-compose version`:

```console
$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.23.2, build unknown
docker-py version: 3.7.0
CPython version: 3.7.2
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1b  26 Feb 2019
```

### Clone the workshop repo

Clone the repository, which contains the example and task files, from GitHub `https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes.git`. It'll provide all files and tasks used in the Workshop.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes.git
Cloning into 'workshop-container-docker-kubernetes'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 30, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (30/30), done.

remote: Total 30 (delta 3), reused 30 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (30/30), done.
```

Now you are ready to run your first container!

## Running your first Docker containers

This section will guide you through starting your first container and the process of starting a WordPress container with a MariaDB database container.

### Hello World!

Now to start your first container and test your Docker installation, we will start like when learning a new programming language, with a simple example: a "Hello World" container.

To run the "Hello World" container, you just run the following command:

```console
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:2557e3c07ed1e38f26e389462d03ed943586f744621577a99efb77324b0fe535
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

```

When everything went correct, you should have a similar output and I can now welcome you to the big world of the containers!

### Basic commands you need to know

These are a few basic Docker commands which are useful and important for working with Docker:

#### `docker ps`

Displays all currently running containers. To display all containers even containers which are not running anymore, add the `-a` flag.

```console
$ docker ps
# Or
$ docker ps -a
```

#### `docker start CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` / `docker stop CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID`

Start or stop a container by sending a `SIGTERM` (`15`) first and after a timeout of default 10 seconds, a `SIGKILL` (`9`) is sent.
Both commands just print out the targeted container(s) name.

```console
$ docker stop my-cool-container
my-cool-container
$ docker start my-cool-container
my-cool-container
```

#### `docker restart CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID`

Stop and start the given container(s). Where `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` is a container ID or name.

```console
$ docker restart my-cool-container
my-cool-container
```

#### `docker rm CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID`

Remove a stopped or exited container. Where `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` is a container ID or name.

```console
$ docker rm my-cool-container
my-cool-container
```

#### `docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID`

Show the logs of a container. Where `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` is a container ID or name.

```console
$ docker logs my-cool-container
[... Many log lines from the my-cool-container application ...]
```

#### `docker images`

List the images with the tags and size which are currently on the Docker host.

```console
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                         TAG                                          IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

  -w, --workdir string                 Working directory inside the container
```

As we can see `docker run` has a lot of flags, to choose from. These flags allow to "configure" how the container should created.

> **NOTE**
>
> Most of these flags are also available for `docker create`, which can be used to create containers but not start them.

In this workshop we are only covering the basic flags, you should know to begin with.

So we are going to focus on the usage part first:

> ```console
$ docker run --help

Usage:	docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

Run a command in a new container
```

> **WDWD**
>
* `[OPTIONS]` - Run flags for the container to be run.
* `IMAGE` - The name of the Container image to use for the container.
* `[COMMAND] [ARG ...]` - Depending on the images, `COMMAND` and `ARG`s will be used either as arguments or as the command + arguments by the so called "entrypoint" of the container.

I'm going in depth about image names, command args and entrypoint later on in ["Understanding Dockerfiles"](#Understanding-Dockerfiles).

### Starting the MariaDB database server

We are going to use the "official" MariaDB Container image from the Docker Hub.
So we will now specify that image as the `IMAGE` argument in our `docker run` command now:

```console
docker run \
    mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
```

When running this command the first time, Docker will pull the image from the Docker Hub and then create the container from it.
But as we have not given any configuration details for it, the "entrypoint" script exits with an error telling us that we need to specify certain environment variables.
The "entrypoint" script is the "first" thing to be executed when the container is started, which happens automatically when using `docker run`.

The output should look something like this:

```console
$ docker run \
   mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
Unable to find image 'mariadb:10.4.3-bionic' locally

error: database is uninitialized and password option is not specified
  You need to specify one of MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD and MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

What is the container named? Can the Docker daemon read our mind and has already named `database`? A random name is given to the container, and thankfully no.
When a container is started and no name is given, it will receive a randomly generated name. It is an actual name and not just some bits and bytes mashed in a mixer, that would be the container id.

In the [Basic commands you need to know](#basic-commands-you-need-to-know) section we have learned about the `docker ps` command. Now we are going to use it to learn more about it and get the name and id of the first try at a `mariadb` container.

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

What's that? No container in the list of running containers. Due to the missing configuration as seen in the above logs the container is not running anymore and has terminated itself.
The `docker ps` command has a flag called `-a` which will show us all container, even those not running anymore:

```console
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
7864ef7db36a        mariadb:10.4.3-bionic   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Exited (1) About a minute ago                       recursing_bell
```

In this case the container (short) ID is `7864ef7db36a` and the generated name is `recursing_bell`, to change that so that we can target the container more easily we are going to give the container a name in the next section.

#### Let's give the container a name before continuing

{{< figure src="hello_my_name_is_docker_container_sticker.png" width="475px" title="Hello my name is: Mr. Docker, Container" >}}

(Original image taken from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hello_my_name_is_sticker.svg)

Our MariaDB database server container should have a name, right? When not specifying a name for the container it will get a randomized name.
Every container gets an unique ID and randomized name. We can set / override the name with the `--name=NAME` flag.
Let's name it "database".

Before running the command again, let's first add a name to the container and add some configuration to it. The configuration part will be done in the next section though.

Adding a name to a container is as simple as adding another flag to the `docker run` command, example:

```console
docker run \
    --name=database \
    mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
```

This gives the container the name `database`, which makes it easier to target the container and simplifies later processes, like connecting from the upcoming WordPress container to the MariaDB database server container.

#### How would one configure the MariaDB database server container?
One big questions will be for you, "How can I configure the MariaDB database server?" in the container.

You can..
**A)** use config files
or
**B)** use environment variables (portable and the best way).

The most portable way is to use environment variables.
Most containers that are configured through environment variables, have a script, the entrypoint, that sets config variables and a lot more, before the main application / program is started.

In the case of the `mariadb` container image the following environment variables are available for configuration:

* `MYSQL_USER` - Database User to create. User will be given access to the database(s) from `MYSQL_DATABASE`.
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD` - Password for the given database user.
* `MYSQL_DATABASE` - Database to create and gain access to the username given in `MYSQL_USER`.
* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` - Root user password for database server.
* `MYSQL_ROOT_HOST` - Root user allowed host (range) for database server.
* And more to configure the database more granular..

To specify an environment variable, the `--env` (or `-e` short form) flag can be used:

```console
docker run \
[...]
    --env 'MYSQL_USER=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secure_password' \
    -e 'MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%' \
[...]
```

_\*sarcasm on\* 100% secure passwords used here \*sarcasm off\*_

> Use secure passwords when running in production!
> `openssl rand -base64 64`, can be used to generate a "secure" passwords.

#### Does the container keep on running or do I need something like screen or what?!

If you run the command to start the container, upon start you see some log output coming, but should notice that when closing the terminal, the database container will be immediately stopped (run `docker ps -a` to see all containers).
When you `docker run` a container, by default your current `stdin` and `stdout` will be attached to the container, making it "interactive" (If you want an interactive container, you should still add `--interactive` flag, so it is clear from that).
If you want as for most applications, like database, web, cache and so on server application, you can disable the attachment of `stdin` and `stdout` by adding the `--detach` (or short `-d`) flag to the command. To view logs of the detached container you can normally use `docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID`.

Have you already run into errors where Docker is telling you that a container with the same exists? You need to delete exited / stopped containers with the `docker rm CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` command (where `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` would be, is the name or ID of the container, e.g., `database`), this "clears" their name and removes the container.

The command to delete the container named `database` is like this:
```console
$ docker rm database
database
```

> **NOTE**
>
> On success it will print out the name of the container(s) stopped.

#### How do I save the database data outside the container?

You want to save your data outside of the container, for a simple reason: If you stop and delete the container, your data is gone. For this Docker has volumes.
A Volume is like a mount from the host system inside the container.
The volume flag is `--volume` (or `-v`). The syntax of the volume flag is for example:

```console
docker run \
[...]
    -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH:MODE \
[...]
```

> **WDWD**
>
* `HOST_PATH` - Path to mount from the host system inside the container.
* `CONTAINER_PATH` - "Mount" destination path in the container.
* `:MODE` - Optional. Can be `rw` (read-write), `ro` (read-only), `z` / `Z` cause files to be SELinux relabeled on the path. Default is `rw`.
>
> **NOTE**
>
* If the host path doesn't exist it'll get created.
* The host path can be a file too.
* Docker doesn't distinguish between file or folder. If the path doesn't exist, a directory always get's created.

#### Running the MariaDB database server container

Now we have all components, we need for running the MariaDB container.

When we have put everything we learned now together, we should get something that looks like this:

```console
docker run \
    -d \
    --name=database \
    -e 'MYSQL_USER=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secure_password' \
    -e 'MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%' \
    -v /opt/docker/wordpress/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
```

> **WDWD**
>
* `-d` - To run the container detached.
* `--name=wordpress` - Gives the container the name "wordpress".
* `-e ...=...` - Specify each an environment variables to be added to the container, as seen in [How would one configure the MariaDB database server container?](#how-would-one-configure-the-mariadb-database-server-container).
* `-v /opt/docker/wordpress/mysql:/var/lib/mysql` - Mount `/opt/docker/wordpress/mysql` directory of the host to inside the container at `/var/lib/mysql`.
* `mariadb:10.4.3-bionic` - Specifies what image to use.

If you run the run command with the `--detach` (or `-d`), it'll just return the unique (long) ID of the container.
With `docker logs CONTAINER` (where `CONTAINER` is a container ID or name), you'll get the logs of the first process in the container.

### How do you execute a command / get a shell inside a container?

Let's check the MariaDB server if the wanted `wordpress` database has been created. For that we need to execute a command inside the `database` container.

To execute a command inside a container, for example in the MariaDB `database` container for, e.g., maintenance access.

The following `mysql` command will execute the `SHOW DATAbASE` query which lists the existing databases:

```console
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

The command `docker exec` can be used to execute a separate command inside a container.

Running `docker exec --help` will shows the help menu:
> **EXAMPLE**
```console
$ docker exec --help

Usage:	docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Run a command in a running container

Options:
  -d, --detach               Detached mode: run command in the background
      --detach-keys string   Override the key sequence for detaching a container
  -e, --env list             Set environment variables
  -i, --interactive          Keep STDIN open even if not attached
      --privileged           Give extended privileges to the command
  -t, --tty                  Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  -u, --user string          Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
  -w, --workdir string       Working directory inside the container
```

To run a command interactively for example opening an interactive MariaDB shell session, the command would be:

```console
docker exec \
    -it \
    CONTAINER \
    mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

> **WDWD**
>
* `-i` - Attach the stdin aka "interactive mode".
* `-t` - Optional. Allocate a pseudo-TTY (pseudo TeleTYpewriter) to the shell / command run.
* `CONTAINER` - Container ID or name of the container the command should be executed in.
* `mysql -u root -p` - The command and arguments for the command to execute inside the container.

You can also use the `--detach` (or `-d`) option to exec the command non-interactively inside the container with no logs or exit code).

When running the above `docker exec` command, be sure to enter the MySQL `root` user password when prompted for it.

> **NOTE**
>
> To be able to run a command in the container, the command / binary / file has to exist in the container! Also to note that when the command / binary is not in the containers `PATH`, you must give the full absolute path to it.

### Summary of what we did so far

We now have a MariaDB 10.4.3 container running which is configured to create a database named `wordpress` with a user named `wordpress` and password `wordpress`.

Now we are going to move on to create the WordPress container which will use the database container.

***

### Starting the WordPress container

So you now already know some "basics", about starting containers. I'm not going in depth with every little thing anymore.

#### How can the WordPress container and the MariaDB container communicate with each other?

{{< figure src="cat5-cat6-internet-807540.png" width="650px" title="Got network communication for your containers?" >}}

(Original photo taken from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/photo/cat5-cat6-internet-network-807540/) Free stock photo site)

In Docker in general by default all containers can talk to each other, if they know the IP address.

> **NOTE** There is an option for the Docker daemon that is called `Inter Container Communication` (`ICC`) `--icc=[true/false]`, default `true`, but disabling this may have other implications than just stopping ICC communication too.

So now to make sure the WordPress container can talk to the MariaDB container, we could use the IP address of the MariaDB container. To get the IP address of the container we can use `docker inspect CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE` (where `CONTAINER_OR_IMAGE` is the unique ID or name of the container). `docker inspect` command will return a JSON output with "all" informations about the given container(s), but is also working for Docker containers image(s) (`docker images`).

But it would be too much work to keep the IP address up to date, when the container gets a new IP address! That is where the "Docker Networking" feature comes into play.

So to be able to use this Docker Networking feature, we need to create a network for the application containers.
This can be done using `docker network create` command:

```console
docker network \
    create \
    [OPTIONS] \
    [NETWORK_NAME]
```

> **WDWD**
>
* `OPTIONS` - Options for the `docker network create` command.
* `NETWORK_NAME` - The name of the network to be created.

Running the following command, will create a new network in Docker which means there is a new network device on the server created too:

```console
docker network \
    create \
    wordpress
```

This new network device can be seen in the output below:

> **EXAMPLE**
```console
$ docker network create wordpress
4cc4efd905ff369efdf691dfe9d20c7c55775e628ccb57cc3fdac499785ea05b

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

#### Network - `resolv.conf` and hostnames

As we are talking about network, let's take a quick look at the `resolv.conf` and hostnames.
Running the following commands will show you the `resolv.conf` and hostname of the container (output below the **WDWD** explanation):

```console
$ docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --entrypoint=/bin/bash \
    wordpress:5.1-php7.1-apache
$ hostname
$ cat /etc/hosts
$ exit
# The `--rm` flag takes care of removing the container then, so no need to manually delete the container
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `--rm` - Causes the container to be deleted when stopped / exited.
> * `--entrypoint=/bin/bash` - This overwrites the command executed (as proccess number #1 in the container), when the container is started.

```console
$ docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --entrypoint=/bin/bash \
    wordpress:5.1-php7.1-apache
root@7c329dddc849:/var/www/html# hostname
7c329dddc849
```

Every container is getting a random hostname, you can override the hostname of a container using the `--hostname=HOSTNAME` flag for `docker run` / `docker create`. As a general note your application should try to not rely on the hostname too much, that can also be important for later on with Kubernetes.

```console
root@7c329dddc849:/var/www/html# cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search lan
nameserver 172.16.1.1
```

The `resolv.conf` is partially passed through from the host system. Meaning that in this example `172.16.1.1` is the address of the local nameserver I'm using (`172.16.1.1/24` is the network range the host is in).

```console
root@7c329dddc849:/var/www/html# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0	ip6-localnet
ff00::0	ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1	ip6-allnodes
ff02::2	ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.3	7c329dddc849
root@7c329dddc849:/var/www/html# exit
```

The `/etc/hosts` file is generated per container and has the hostname of the container as an entry in it. As we can see the hostname does not resolve to `127.0.0.1`, where everyone feels at home, but to the IP of the container (depending on who you ask this is good or bad, to be left uncommented).

#### Let's connect the database container to the `wordpress` network

There are two choices to connect the database container to the `wordpress` network:

* Stop, delete and create the database container again but now with the `--net=wordpress` flag added to the `docker run` command:
```console
docker run \
    -d \
    --net=wordpress \
    --name=database \
    -e 'MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secure_password' \
    -e 'MYSQL_USER=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress' \
    -e 'MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress' \
    -v /opt/docker/wordpress/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
```

* Use the `docker network connect` command:

```console
docker network connect [NETWORK_NAME] [CONTAINER_NAME]
```

In this case that would be:

```console
docker network connect wordpress database
```

The command connects the `database` container to the `wordpress` network, that we previously created.

Now that the `database` container is in the `wordpress` network, we can go ahead and begin to start the WordPress instance.

#### Running the WordPress container

To configure our WordPress container, the Container image comes with extra environment variables.
The WordPress container image name is `wordpress` ([Docker Hub - WordPress Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)) and the tag for now is `5.1-php7.1-apache`.

The possible environment variables for the configuration are the following ones:

* `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=...` - Set to `database` so it will connect to the `database` container.
* `WORDPRESS_DB_USER=...` - Set to `wordpress` as we have configured the `database` container to create a user with name `wordpress`.
* `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=...` - Set to `wordpress` as we have configured the `database` container to create the `wordpress` user with password `wordpress`.
* `WORDPRESS_MYSQL_DATABASE=...` - Set to `wordpress` as we have configured the `database` container to create a database `wordpress` for the `wordpress` user.
* `WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=...`, `WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=...`, `WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=...`, `WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=...`, `WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=...`, `WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=...`, `WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT` - These need to be set to a secure random value; in production use different random values per variable.
* And other ones which are "optional" in regards to getting the WordPress container up'n'running.

The command to run the WordPress container should look like this now:

```console
docker run \
    -d \
    --net=wordpress \
    --name=wordpress \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=database' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=wordpress' \
    -e 'WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT=wordpress' \
    -p 80:80 \
    wordpress:5.1-php7.1-apache
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `-d` - To run the container detached.
> * `--net=wordpress` - Put the container inside the `wordpress` network, we created earlier.
> * `--name=wordpress` - Gives the container the name `wordpress`.
> * `-e ...=...` - Specifies environment variables, that are used for configuration.
> * `wordpress:5.1-php7.1-apache` - Specifies what image to use.

Now execute the command and you should be able to see the WordPress installation screen at `http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER:80`.

> **NOTE**

> All data inside the container, will be lost on removal of the container! In our case, we already use volumes, so don't worry.

For cleanup you now stop and delete the containers.

To stop the `wordpress` , run `docker stop CONTAINER` (where `CONTAINER` in this case is `wordpress`). After stopping the container, you can remove it with `docker rm CONTAINER`.
The container has to be stopped, before it can be removed.

#### How can the WordPress container be reached from the outside world now?

Right now it can't but we can change this by making the webserver port (`80`) available to the "public", by publishing / exposing the port(s).
That is what the `--publish` (or `-p`) flag is used for, in this format:

```console
docker run \
[OTHER_OPTIONS] \
#   -p HOST_ADDRESS:HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT/PROTOCOL
    -p 80:80/tcp \
[...]
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `HOST_ADDRESS:` - Optional. By default `0.0.0.0`. Address to expose the port on the host system.
> * `HOST_PORT` - Host port to expose the container port on.
> * `CONTAINER_PORT` - Container port to expose.
> * `/PROTOCOL` - Optional. By default `tcp`. The port protocol, currently can be `tcp` or `udp`.

And that's how you forward / publish ports from the container to the outside.

## Summary of what we did so far

You should now be able to list containers, start up container, create a network for your containers and be able to access them from the "outside".

Please make sure to stop and / or remove stopped / terminated containers.

Now that we looked into some of most important beginner topics of Docker, we are going to take a look deeper into these topics.

## Data, Data everywhere!

{{< figure src="data-data-everywhere-meme.png" width="350px" title="Data Data everywhere! Meme - Made with Imgur Memegen" >}}

### Volumes aka Mounts

Volumes add persistence to your data. When a container is stopped and removed, the data in the container is lost.
With a volume you would mount the part of the data out of the container. For example with our MariaDB container, we would mount the container path `/var/lib/mysql/` (contains the MariaDB databases) somewhere safe.
So if the MariaDB server inside the container should ever crash and the container then be terminated, you can just fire up with the `docker start` command or delete the container and execute the `docker run` command again. The MariaDB container then starts using the data where it exited.

I already showed the option, but here is it again (Long form `--volume=`):

```console
docker run \
[OPTIONS]
    -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH:MODE
[IMAGE] [ARGUMENTS]
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `HOST_PATH` - Path to mount from the host system inside the container.
> * `CONTAINER_PATH` - "Mount" destination path in the container.
> * `:MODE` - Is optional. Can be `rw` (read-write) or `ro` (read-only). Defaults to `rw`.
>
> **TL;DR**
>
> `-v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH` allows you to store data from containers on the host.
>
> **NOTE**
>
> When the host path doesn't exist, it will be created. BUT the permissions will be a bit "freaky", when the path get's created on the host, the directory will be (by default) owned by `root:root`, directory permissions `drwxr-xr-x`.

### `docker volume` command

Docker nowadays also allows to create volumes for containers locally but also through available storage drivers.

Through plugins for the Docker Engine you can access multiple different storage systems / softwares.
A list of volume plugins can be found here: [Docker Engine Documentation - Volume Plugins](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/legacy_plugins/#volume-plugins).

This in general is pretty useful as the Docker engine takes care to provide a volume for your container(s), but in regards to the second day when we start to run Kubernetes we will see that Docker doesn't matter too much anymore with such features.

To mention it already there is a new interface for requesting / "managing" storage, which is named **C**ontainer **S**torage **I**nterface (CSI). The goal of CSI is to have an unified interface through which anyone can request storage. Mounting of the requested storage is done by the storage dependent CSI driver then.

### Data containers  aka `--volumes-from` (DEPRECATED)

> **NOTE**
>
> * I do NOT recommend this method as I often enough "accidentally" clear all exited / dead containers, so my disk space doesn't run out.
> * I also have cron jobs running on my servers, that clean exited containers. Meaning data containers would just get cleared out everytime.

You can store data inside another container, that's called data volume containers.
When creating an image, you can specify those volumes. You create a container that has a volume "built-into" (Specified while the image was built), meaning that assuming it is our MariaDB server image the in-built volume would be located at `/var/lib/mysql`
The data volume container runs "nothing", it is just there for purpose of getting used by another container. For this you change the entrypoint with the following run option `--entrypoint=COMMAND` (where command could be just `/bin/true`) so the container stops and doesn't run the program it should.

Now that we would have a data container, we can use the volumes from this container using the `--volumes-from=CONTAINER` (where `CONTAINER` is a container name or ID) option.

Let's assume we have a data container, created from the example here, with the volume `/data` and we have a second container, running the same image, that would save the data to `/data`.
In this case using the `--volumes-from` option would write the data inside the first container, the data container.

**I personally don't recommend data container for data sharing, as I find it a bad practice to store data inside a ephemeral container.**

## Networking

{{< figure src="network-stuff-brace-yourself-meme.png" width="350px" title="Brace Yourself Network Stuff Incoming - Made using Imgur Memegen" >}}

### NATing your way into my container

> I'm not going to explain NAT in-depth here.

Network Address Translation (NAT) allows multiple devices to sit behind the same IP address.

Docker creates `iptables` rules to allow traffic to the container.

### Over seven bridges you must go (docker0 bridge and veth interfaces)

By default Docker creates a bridge called `docker0`, that is used as a bridge to your "normal" network interface(s) (e.g., `eth0`, `en0`, etc).
The `docker0` bridge tries to find an unoccupied network range, mostly from the `172.17.0.1/16` IP range as a network. This IP address range will be used, to assign every container a separate IP.
Sometimes the bridge address range needs to be adjusted, even though Docker tries it's "best" to find a free IP range. In most cases when you are running Docker in a corporate network, get in touch with your network team to ask for a "free range".

> **NOTE**
>
> To manually override the Docker bridge address, you can add the `--bip=192.168.1.0/24` (where `192.168.1.0/24` is an unused IP range) to your Docker Daemon flags in the Systemd Unit file or through the "config" files, e.g., on Debian based systems `/etc/default/docker` or on RHEL based systems `/etc/sysconfig/docker` or `/etc/sysconfig/docker-network`.

> **EXAMPLE** `docker0` interface
> ```auto
$ ip addr show docker0
4: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
    link/ether 02:42:d1:cc:07:47 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:d1ff:fecc:747/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

When a container is created, a `veth` interface will be created (depending on the network mode, [next section](#network-modes-default-host-or-other)). The `veth` interface will have an unique name.
`veth` stands for virtual ethernet device and it will be connected to the `docker0` bridge, to acquire network connectivity.
The veth interface will not show the IP address when using tools like `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` on the host, but you are able to see the IP inside the container.

> **EXAMPLE** `veth` interface of container from host
> ```auto
$ ip addr show veth9af2aa6
138: veth9af2aa6@if137: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-4cc4efd905ff state UP group default
    link/ether be:e2:72:ce:72:1b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet6 fe80::bce2:72ff:fece:721b/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Previously we also had it about other networks / bridges in regards to `docker network` commands. When running `docker network create` a new bridge will be created which has its "own" IP range as can been seen in the example output.

> **EXAMPLE** `docker network create` "normal" bridge on host
```auto
$ ip addr show br-4cc4efd905ff
104: br-4cc4efd905ff: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:90:e4:8d:a1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-4cc4efd905ff
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:90ff:fee4:8da1/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

You can view the IP address and much more information of containers, using `docker inspect CONTAINER_NAME`:

> **EXAMPLE** `docker inspect database`
> ```auto
$ docker inspect database
[
    {
        [...]
        "Name": "/database",
        [...]
        "NetworkSettings": {
            [...]
            "Ports": {
                "3306/tcp": null
            },
            [...]
            "Networks": {
                "wordpress": {
                    [...]
                    "Gateway": "172.18.0.1",
                    "IPAddress": "172.18.0.2",
                    "IPPrefixLen": 16,
                    [...]
                    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                    [...]
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

#### Multi Machine Network

Docker Swarm, which is the "clustered" mode / "version" of Docker, can allow you to create an overlay network, between multiple machines. But I'm not going deeper into this here.
For people interested in this feature, see the [Docker Docs `network create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/).

#### IPv6

{{< figure src="i-think-we-have-a-problem-cheezeburger.png" width="300px" title="'State of IPv6 and containers' - Image taken from Cheezburger.com" >}}

> _Let's not talk about that, okay ..?_

With Docker itself it is not too much of a problem to use IPv6, but sadly not too optimal.

You can have IPv4 and IPv6, but let's concern ourselves with that when we are looking at Kubernetes. Reason for looking at this topic first in Kubernetes is that, in Kubernetes you won't really use the networking of Docker anymore.

### Network modes ("default", host or other)

I've wrote, that I'm not going deeper into Docker's own (overlay) network feature, but with this topic, I'll have to go into it just a bit.

When running a container in the default network mode (named `default`, `--net=default`). The `default` network mode causes every container to get a separate network interface / stack.

There is also the network mode `host` available by default. The `host` network mode gives the host network stack aka "full access to the network of the host system" inside the container.

The `--net` flag can also take a name of a network which has been created using the `docker network` command, e.g, as used in the example `wordpress` as the network name `--net=wordpress`.

> **NOTE**
>
> For the upcoming example outputs, the `docker0` bridge uses the `172.17.0.1/16`!

The below snippet shows how the contaienr inside network looks for "default" (/ unspecified) network mode:

> **EXAMPLE**
> ```console
HOST $ docker run -it debian:jessie ip addr show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
141: eth0@if142: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

As you can see the container is getting an IP from the `docker0` bridge.

What about using the host's network with `--net=host`?

> **EXAMPLE**
> ```console
$ docker run -it --net=host debian:jessie ip addr show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enp4s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether REDACTED brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.1.99/24 brd 172.16.1.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic enp4s0
       valid_lft 5204sec preferred_lft 5204sec
    inet6 REDACTED/64 scope global noprefixroute dynamic
       valid_lft 86396sec preferred_lft 14396sec
    inet6 fe80::800b:52b6:865b:5444/64 scope link noprefixroute

    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:d1ff:fecc:747/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
104: br-4cc4efd905ff: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:90:e4:8d:a1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-4cc4efd905ff
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:90ff:fee4:8da1/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
138: veth9af2aa6@if137: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-4cc4efd905ff state UP group default
    link/ether be:e2:72:ce:72:1b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::bce2:72ff:fece:721b/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The container is getting full access to the host's network stack when using `--net=host`.

The `br-4cc4efd905ff` interface is the `wordpress` network previously created.

> **WARNING**
>
> This means that there are no namespaces between the host's network stack and the container!
>
> A container running with `--net=host` can potentially shutdown your server.
> Only use `--net=host` when you know what you are doing and what the implications are.

Just for comparsion here the `ip addr show` output directly from the host to compare it with the above output from the container.

> **EXAMPLE**
> ```console
HOST $ ip addr show

```



### Publishing ports

Docker creates `iptables` rules so published (/ exposing) ports are reachable from the host itself but also from the outside.

In the below example output below, all `iptables` rules are shown that are created when one container is publishing / exposing port `3000/TCP`:

> **EXAMPLE**

```

As we can see Docker uses a separate `DOCKER` chain in the `FORWARD` chain, to map incoming traffic on port 80 to the container IP.
After the destination IP has been changed, Docker uses DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation), to "map" the traffic to the container's end address.

> **TASK** [`network101`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/network101)

You can use the script `show_me_dat_network.sh` from task `network101`, to view your network interfaces and current `iptables` rules.

### Looking into your network

> **TASK** [`network101`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/network101)

Do you want to visualize your container network situation? Yes? Then the perfect tool for this is Weave Scope.

In the `network101` task is a file called `start_weave_scope.sh`. The script downloads the Weave Scope wrapper script, that starts the containers needed for Weave Scope to function.
The commands that are used to download the Weave Scope wrapper script are:
```console
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/scope https://git.io/scope
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope
sudo scope launch
```

After the image of the container has been pulled and started, you can then navigate to `http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER:4040` to see the Weave Scope UI.

{{< figure src="weavescope_ui.png" width="900px" title="Weave Scope UI" >}}

Through the Weave Scope UI you gain an immersive insight into your network of the containers.

## Limiting container resources

{{< figure src="its-ok-i-know-my-limit-meme.png" width="250px" title="It's OK I know my limit - said the rogue process" >}}

As I already mentioned in the [Container!?](#Container) part, namespaces are able to limit the resources available to processes, etc.

### CPU Limit

Limiting the precious computing resource of a container.

```console
$ docker run --help
[...]
  --cpu-period                    Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period
  --cpu-quota                     Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota
  --cpuset-cpus                   CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
[...]
```
You can limit the time period and the quota of the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler).
Limiting a container to specific cores is also possible (`--cpuset-cpus`).

### Memory and Swap Limit

```console
$ docker run --help
[...]
  --cpuset-mems                   MEMs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
[...]
  --kernel-memory                 Kernel memory limit
[...]
  --memory-reservation            Memory soft limit
  --memory-swap                   Swap limit equal to memory plus swap: '-1' to enable unlimited swap
  --memory-swappiness=-1          Tune container memory swappiness (0 to 100)
[...]
  --oom-kill-disable              Disable OOM Killer
  --oom-score-adj                 Tune host's OOM preferences (-1000 to 1000)
[...]
```
As you can see, there is a good amount of option to play around with the memory a container can use and how it can use the memory.

A good feature if you have limited memory available is to play with the memory swappiness.

The `OOM` (Linux Out of Memory Management) options are good, if you have memory intensive applications, but only limited memory available. So important application container don't get killed, when the system should run out of memory.

## Selfies? I mean Images

An image is the core of a container. Without an image, there would be no container.
Creating images is simple to do, depending on what you try to "containerize".
In this part we set a simple goal. Our goal is to create a container that runs nginx in it.

### Image Names explained

Images that "come" from the [Docker Image Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), don't need a repository specified.

The image we used for the MariaDB container is:

```console
mariadb:10.4.3-bionic
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `sameersbn` - The username of the creator.
> * `mysql` - The image name.
> * `latest` - The "version" tag. The tag can be anything, but emojis.

An example for an image that is pulled from a different image server, than the official Docker Hub, is my [Prometheus DellHW Exporter](https://github.com/galexrt/dellhw_exporter) image that is hosted on [quay.io](https://quay.io):

```console
quay.io/galexrt/dellhw_exporter:v1.3.5
SERVER/USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `quay.io`, `SERVER` - Defaults to `docker.io`. The image repository server to pull the image from.
> * `galexrt`, `USERNAME` - Username of the image author / uploader.
> * `dellhw_exporter`, `IMAGE_NAME` - Name of the image.
> * `v1.3.5`, `TAG` - Like git tags. When not specified, the default is `latest`.

In the case of official created images, like the WordPress image we used no server and username is required (by default).
Official images are "marked" by not having a username in the image "address". When browsing such iamges on Docker Hub, the URL does have an underscore instead of a username, e.g., `https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/`.

### What have Layer Cakes to do with Container Images?

{{< figure src="layer-cake-from-wikimedia.png" width="850px" title="Mhh, tasty, isn't it? But now back to the topic." >}}

> **TASK**: [`dockerfile101`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/dockerfile101)

In the Docker universe, a Container image is built from the bottom to the top like a cake, the bottom is a baseimage (or any other image as a base).
Every "new" layer on top of it, is an action that had been run when building the image.

Meaning if we create an image from the baseimage `fedora:29` like the example `Dockerfile`, a cross-section / profile would look like this:

{{< figure src="container-image-layers-diagram.png" width="750px" title="Dockerfile Steps / Container Image Layers" >}}

That is one of the reasons, why Container images are so small. If you download 10 images that are based on `debian:jessie`, you would only have to download the created / modified layers, because the baseimage is the same for these 10 images.
To build / create an image, you create a Dockerfile and that's what we are going to talk about next.

### Dockerfile examples

As you may have already seen in the current task directory `dockerfile101`, there is a file called `Dockerfile`.
A `Dockerfile` contains container image build instructions. `Dockerfile`s have their own syntax, but the syntax is pretty simple.

I'm going to show you two more or less advanced Dockerfile examples in the next section, one for a Golang and one for a Python application.

#### Golang application with Dependency Dockerfile Example

Taken from the [GitHub project galexrt/dellhw_exporter](https://github.com/galexrt/dellhw_exporter), file `Dockerfile`.

### Understanding Dockerfiles

> **TASK**: [`dockerfile202`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/dockerfile202)
>
> **TIP**
>
> If you have trouble writing a `Dockerfile`, checkout the [Dockerfile Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for the full "syntax".

You will create an image with `nginx` installed (You can later expand it, with more functionality, like with PHP-FPM).

To guide you in creating a nginx image, I show you an example of a http webserver application written in golang, before you are going to create your own `nginx` image.

**Golang Dockerfile Example**:
```console
# golang image where workspace (GOPATH) configured at /go.
FROM golang:1.12.2-stretch

# Add a label to the image so everyone knows who is maintaing it.
LABEL maintainer="John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"

# Copy the local package files to the containerâ€™s workspace.
ADD . /go/src/github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes

# Build the project inside the container.
RUN go install github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes

# Run the  command when the container starts.
ENTRYPOINT ["/go/bin/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes"]

# http server listens on port 8080.
EXPOSE 8080
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `FROM ...` - Sets the baseimage.
> * `LABEL ...=...` - Labels to add to the image, in key value pairs (`KEY=VALUE`).
> * `COPY ... ...` - Copy files from the build root.
> * `ADD ... ...` - Same as `COPY`, but target can be "online" and if it is an archive, it will be extracted.
> * `RUN ...` - Run commands (Shell used `/bin/sh`).
> * `ENTRYPOINT ["..."]` - The command to execute when the container is started.
> * `CMD ["..."]` - Arguments for the `ENTRYPOINT`.
> * `EXPOSE 8080/TCP NUMBER/PROTOCOL...` - Expose a port (This is important when linking containers together, as otherwise the port would not reachable from the other containers). Protocol can be `TCP` or `UDP`.

There's even the possibility, to execute specific commands when the image is used as a base image, the base instruction is called `ONBUILD ...`, but explaining this is beyond the scope of this training. Thanks for understanding!

> The `ONBUILD` instruction adds to the image a _trigger_ instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build. The trigger will be executed in the context of the downstream build, as if it had been inserted immediately after the FROM instruction in the downstream `Dockerfile`.
>
> â€“ Quote from [Docker Dockerfile Documentation - ONBUILD section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild)

To build an image we use the `docker build` command. Building this golang example image, we run the following command:

```console
docker build -f Dockerfile -t workshop-gowebapp .
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `build` - Used to build Container images.
> * `-t IMAGE_NAME` - Specify the name (with an optional tag) of the image, you are creating. `IMAGE_NAME` is a string name for the image with an optional tag specified. The tag is added by adding double dots like this `:TAG_NAME`. This flag in itself is optional.
>     * **NOTE** This options is useful when manually building and pushing a Container image to a repository, so you can specify the name of the image as you want.
> * `-f DOCKERFILE` - Set the location of the `Dockerfile` (Optional).
> * `.` - The image build root of the image build (**Important** when `ADD` or `COPY` is used in the `Dockerfile`). All files will be at least added to the build environment for easy access, but not added to the image itself.

As you can see, it isn't hard to build your first Container images.
If you want to see more advanced examples, you can find more examples in my GitHub repositories [here](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Agalexrt+docker-).

### Commands you need to know when working with Container images

#### Listing the Container images

To list the Container images, use the `docker images` command:

```console
docker images
```

The command can also take a name of an image, but then it will only show quick overview of the given image.

#### Deleting a Container image

To delete a Container image, you use the `docker rmi` command. The syntax is basically the same as for the `docker rm` command:

```console
docker rmi IMAGE [IMAGE...]
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `rmi` - The subcommand for deleting one or more image(s).
> * `IMAGE [IMAGE...]` - One or more image names or IDs to delete.

#### Build a Container image from Dockerfile

Use this command to build images:

```console
docker build -t IMAGE_NAME -f DOCKERFILE BUILD_PATH
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `build` - The build subcommand.
> * `-t IMAGE_NAME` - More details to `IMAGE_NAME` are going to be explained in a later section, [here](#Image-Names-explained) or see above **WDWD** part.
> * `DOCKERFILE` - Path to a Dockerfile. Defaults to the current work directory with `Dockerfile` attached as a file name.
> * `BUILD_PATH` - The build root path. Files in the directory will be added to the Docker build environment, but not to the image itself. The files are only added when the specified Dockerfile has instructions to do so. You can't go deeper than the `BUILD_PATH`!

### Let's build your first Container image

Now that we know some `Dockerfile` basics, we can start building our own `nginx` image from the baseimage `debian:jessie`.

Let's make this like a test in the school, replace all `__BLANK__` with the correct answer (Solutions are [here](#nginx-Dockerfile)):

```console
FROM __BLANK__

RUN __BLANK__

ENTRYPOINT ["__BLANK__"]
```

Got all blanks filled out? Good. Let's build the image:

```console
docker build -t workshop-nginx .
```

> **Expected Output of `docker build -t workshop-nginx .`**
>
> ```console

```

The build should go successfully, when you filled in the blanks correctly. Let's run the image to see if it is working, the container name will be `workshop-nginx`:

```console
docker run \
    --name=workshop-nginx \
    -d \
    -p 80:80 \
    workshop-nginx
```

If you did something wrong, remove the container using (where `CONTAINER_NAME` is a container ID or name):

```console
docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
```

To check if the container is running with your image, run `docker ps -a`.

> **WDWD**
>
> * `ps` - Like the `ps ` command, but for the containers.
> * `-a` - Show all containers, whether their current state, without it showing only running containers.

You should see that the container you started, has exited.
There's a simple reason, why the container exited / stopped. When running a command as the entrypoint, it has to stay running, not fork to background. When the process forks to background, Docker will think the process has stopped and the container status will be set to `exited` with the last return code.

That's why we need to tell `nginx`, not to run as a daemon, not fork to background, with the following additional arguments `"-g", "daemon off;"` (these arguments must be added to the `ENTRYPOINT` line of the `Dockerfile`).

So we could make a change to the `nginx.conf`, overwrite `nginx.conf` with a custom one or **just change** the `ENTRYPOINT` line to make it look like this:

```console
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Let's rebuild the image (same `docker build` command) and run it again. Open `http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER:8080` in your browser and voilÃ  it should show the nginx default page.

To go further with your created image, let's "mount" a volume inside the container with our own `index.html`.
Use the `index.html` from task `dockerfile202` or create one yourself.

Now we add a volume to the container. Add `-v "$(pwd)":"/usr/share/nginx/html"` to the `docker run` command, but don't forget add the argument before the image name.
Your command should look like this:

```console
docker run \
    --name=workshop-nginx \
    -d \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v "$(pwd)":"/usr/share/nginx/html" \
    workshop-nginx
```

This starts a container named `workshop-nginx` running the image `workshop-nginx` with a volume mounted at `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
Run the command and if everything went well after a few seconds, you can now open `http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER:8080` in the browser. You should see the contents of the previously created `index.html`. Well done!

### How can this help in the development workflow?

If you are for example creating a new CMS written in PHP, you could create a Dockerfile for it so that a Container image can be created for it.
On every push to the git repository of the project, the image could be built and automatic checks could be run, to ensure every feature is working fine.

For example Travis CI has switched big parts of their build infrastructure to Docker containers.
Quoting Travis CIsome headings from their [blog post](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/):

> Builds start in seconds
> Faster builds
> More available resources in a build container
> Better network capacity, availability and throughput
> Easier to scale

As we can see, containers can be better than VMs depending on the use case.

Due to the lower resource usage, containers are good for the development workflow, making it faster and cheaper in the end.

***

## "Composing" containers together with `docker-compose`

### Making multi container applications easier to start

> **TASK**: [`compose101`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/compose101)

To remove the process of typing all `docker run` and so on, commands to start the containers, `docker-compose` has been created.
`docker-compose` makes it _easy peasy lemon squeezy_ to run one to many containers using one command.
The syntax of a `docker-compose.yml` is YAML. As it is just YAML, you can basically just use a YAML syntax checker, e.g., [Online YAML Parser](https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/).

In our example with WordPress we will create a `docker-compose.yml` for our MariaDB database server, WordPress and as an extra we'll add phpMyAdmin to it too.

Create the `docker-compose.yml` file. I made this part like a test again, so you can see where you have knowledge holes, replace all `__BLANK__` with the correct answer (the solution is available in the `docker-compose-solution.yml` file of task `compose101`):

```console
version: '3.1'
services:
  # mariadb database image configuration, see https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb
  database:
    image: "mariadb:10.4.3-bionic"
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secure_password
      MYSQL_ROOT_HOST: '%'
    volumes:
      - "/opt/docker/database:/var/lib/mysql:rw"
  # wordpress image configuration, see https://hub.docker.com/r/_/wordpress/
  wordpress:
    image: "wordpress:5.1-php7.1-apache"
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: "__BLANK__"
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: __BLANK__
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: __BLANK__
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: __BLANK__
      WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY: SECURE_AUTH_KEY
      WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY: SECURE_LOGGED_IN_KEY
      WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT: SECURE_AUTH_SALT
      WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT: SECURE_LOGGED_IN_SALT
  # phpmyadmin image configuration, see https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/
  phpmyadmin:
    image: "phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:4.8"
    ports:
      - 8181:80
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: database
      PMA_USER: root
      PMA_PASSWORD: secure_password
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `database:` - Name of the container.
> * `  image:` - Defines the used image for the container.
> * `  links: []` - A list of container links.
> * `  ports: []` - A list of published ports.
> * `  environment: []` - Key / Value list of environment variables (Format: `NAME: VALUE`).

I have also added the environment variables `DB_REMOTE_ROOT_NAME` and `DB_REMOTE_ROOT_PASS`, so that Admin can access the MariaDB server.

#### Networking Changes

As you might have spotted the above `docker-compose` file does not have anything related to which `network` to use in it.
That is because `docker-compose` creates a `network` based on the "project name" by default, meaning that there is no need in our case to create another network.

### Starting our multi container applications with one command

> **TASK**: [`compose101`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/compose101)

To run / start the content of the filled out `docker-compose.yml` (if you are too lazy to fill out the file, use the `docker-compose-solutions.yml`) run:

```console
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `docker-compose` - The `docker-compose` command.
> * `-f DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML` - Optional. Defaults to `docker-compose.yml`. `DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML` is a path to a valid `docker-compose` file.
> * `up` - Starts the containers defined in the given docker-compose file.
>
> **EXAMPLE**
> ```console
$ docker-compose up # no need for `-f DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML` flag as the default file is used `docker-compose.yml`

After running the command, you should see log output starting to fill your terminal. To stop the started containers press `CTRL+C`.
Again as with a single container, to detach the container into background when running `docker-compuse up`, add the the `--detach` (or `-d`) flag.

## Basic `docker-compose` commands

There are some `docker-compose` commands you should know when working with the `docker-compose` command.

### Stopping all containers run by the current `docker-compose` file

Instead of the `up`, you just put `stop` there. Stops the containers from the current `docker-compose` file:

```console
docker-compose stop -t TIMEOUT
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `stop` - Stop subcommand.
> * `-t TIMEOUT` - Optional. Timeout to wait for the containers to exit, before the containers get killed.

### Deleting all containers from the current `docker-compose` file

Replacing the `up` with `rm`, deletes all containers that are started by the current `docker-compose` file, but now are stopped or exited:

```console
docker-compose -f DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML rm --force
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `rm` - Subcommand to remove / delete all container started by the selected `docker-compose` file.
> * `--force` - Optional. Forces the removal of the containers.

### Restarting all container started by the current `docker-compose` file

Restarts all containers that are started or have exited by the current `docker-compose` file.
This just stops and starts the containers again. It does not delete and create the containers again.

```console
docker-compose -f DOCKER_COMPOSE_YML restart
```

> **WDWD**
>
> * `restart` - Subcommand to stop and then start all containers of the selected `docker-compose` file.

### Let's play some more with `docker-compose`!

> **TASK**: [`compose202`](https://github.com/galexrt/workshop-container-docker-kubernetes/tree/master/compose202)
>
> The task directory contains some other `docker-compose.yml` files for you to play around with. Look at the `docker-compose.yml`s, realize what they do and run 'em.
>
> **TIP**
>
> Keep the `-f DOCKERFILE` option in mind, when dealing with multiple `docker-compose.yml` as in this case in specific.

Let me know if you run into any issues, during "play time" with `docker-compose`.
