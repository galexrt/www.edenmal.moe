Even though I'm in most people's opinion too young to give "life tips", I more or less just wanted to put this list of "points" that have helped me in my life out there.

* Stay hydrated
* "English, motherf*cker, do you speak it?"
* "Open your f*cking mouth" -> Communicate
* Don’t swear too much
* Take chances (but not in Bitcoins)
* Documentation is key
* "Be on time enough"
* "Either do it 100% or don’t."
  * Doing things half "assed" is "sh*t" for all in the end.
* YOLO
  * **Y**ou **O**nly **L**ive **O**nce, so have fun but don't risk to break your neck (all the time).
* Communicate
  * Get a therapist -> Everyone has their "quirks and quarks" and that is perfectly fine! The important part here is about having a neutral "party" (therapist) to talk about "anything", problems, situations, etc.
* Balance your Work and Life
  * Get yourself a balance point.
* Be sure to pet some kittens along the way
* RATFM - Read Apply the F*cking Manual
  * (I wonder if [point 4](#dont-swear-too-much) applies here :-D)
  * Read & Apply The F*cking Manual
* IT Tips
  * `Makefile` are the best
    * Use 'em. They make your life easier.

## "Have Fun!"

That's the "end" of the "life tips" list, but it'll definitely grow over time.

Have Fun!
