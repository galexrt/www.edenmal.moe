This post is not really fitting my blog but I think this is the right place here, it is a tribute to my father who had unexpectedly passed away last year (2019) and a bit of insight in the things happening behind it.

I’m not sure if writing a post is the right thing to do in any way, especially "so late" (almost 6 months). It just feels right to write my thoughts down and to share them. Maybe it helps me, maybe it doesn’t? Who knows? The future holds this answer. Even though the future will probably never fullly "reveal" the answer to these questions.

It was a chill afternoon on a Monday. I’m on my way to hold a customer where I should hold a training. Sitting in the train to get to the customer. I’m getting a call from my mother, but I’m too slow to get my headset connected and miss it. Having my headset connected with my phone, it rings again. I pick up. After saying "Hello Mother", I get a response from a men’s voice. The person says "This is police officer <REDACTED>, are you Alexander T.?".

Have you ever had a "full emergency stop" in your brain?

Everything I thought about, "are my slides all correct?", "how’s the hotel going to be?", "are my demo servers really all working?", and "what will the people be like in the training?", came to an instant halt.

"All hands on deck!"

Why is a police officer calling me from my mother’s phone? Has something happened to her?

I confirm to the officer that I am "Alexander T." The officer continues to ask if I can talk right now, I confirm again, even though I’m in a train cart. At least only one more person was in the “area” I was in. In a calm voice, he says that he has bad "news" for me and that my mother is unable to talk right now.

(The officer has perfectly done this as professional as possible, I’m just summarizing it very roughly which might make it seem it was unprofessionally communicated from the officer)
He continued on, that my father has passed away.

I only remember that the officer asked me if I’m fine, I responded that “I’m fine”, even though I wasn’t. After the first “half” of the call, I heard my mother crying in the background. A few more words were exchanged and the call ended.

After that the world was darker and wet, it is highly probable that this was caused by me crying. It hurt, it hurt like my heart and lungs are ripped apart.

Three more stops. This pain. I’m trying to think clearly. It is hard to that, I can tell you that.

Two more stops. What should I do next? Should I go home? Should I go to the customer?

I need to get off the train now. I grab my bag. Put on my scarf, adjust it to a comfortable position, doors open, I walk a few steps and come to a halt. My legs feel weak, I’m dizzy. Is this real life or just fantasy? This can’t be real, can it? I can’t make any sense of this. My father was healthy and smiling on the weekend. He was ever than better, considering he had 10 stents, or as I’d like to put "Should you get 2 more stents, the hospital is obliged to gift you a steak knife set".

I’m going to stop continuing to write more about the past now. I want to mention Kim-Norman Sahm and Maria Bauer here for the help they brought me on this now dark and cold day.

At least from what the doctors told us, they tried to revive him for an hour and than stopped as there was no point. I’m not sure if I could have done the same, especially as it is my father we are speaking of.

The only thing that makes the circumstances a bit “nicer” in retrospective, is that he didn’t seem to have suffered.

My father was a man who couldn’t say “no”, he wanted to help everyone. Your water pipe is leaking? No problem, my father would help you. He is and was greatly respected by his colleagues at the company he worked at and "ran around" everywhere else. He was a devoted guitar player, and played mostly Rock and Jazz music together with his friends.

You are missed by your wife and your son.

Because of your devotion to guitars, I have put up two of your and mine as a tribute. So at anytime I get sad, I'll just take one of the "Klampfen" down and begin to play the few accords I know to relax.

P.S. Having written this text over two days, I can confirm that it still f*cking hurts, but already a slight tad less than before. Don't worry about me, as I am as called on by my mother and father Alexander "the Great" Trost.

For the people that have watched Fullmetal Alchemist, you might remember the following exchange from a scene, quoted (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7HcPvTew_4):

> Riza Hawkeye: "Are you alright, Colonel?"
>
> Roy Mustang: "Yeah I’m fine. Except, it’s a terrible day for rain."
>
> Riza Hawkeye: "What do you mean? It’s not raining.."
>
> Roy Mustang: "Yes, it is."
>
> Riza Hawkeye: "Oh, so it is."
