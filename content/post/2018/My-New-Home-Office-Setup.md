In this post I'm going over my new game and home office setup.

## New table

First part of the new home setup, was a new table.
The previous was a cheap table from IKEA. The new table is 2.60m long instead of previously only 2.00m.
The 0.60m more space is awesome. The desk feels emptier but in a good way, and I have more space for equipment.

If you have the space, go for a big table and keep it clean!

## Tech stuff

### Power Distribution

The following power strips are used for power distribution:

* 2x [Adam Hall 874716 Power Strip 1 U 19" - 16-port](https://www.thomann.de/intl/adam_hall_874716_power_strip_1_u_19.htm)
* And some [the t.racks Power 8 S - 8-port](https://www.thomann.de/intl/the_t_racks_power_8_s.htm)

The 16-port power strips are pretyy neat and I can recommend them.
(I'll soon "mount" them to the table so that the cables are off the ground)

End goal here would be to finally buy myself a fancy [Uninterruptible power supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply), just in case the apocalypse is happening :-D

### Network

I'm driving a dual WAN setup using a FritzBoxes and a OpenSense firewall router.

OpenSense firewall router box hardware specifications:

* CPU: Intel Celeron G4900
* Fan: Noctua NH-L9x65 CPU-Kühler
* RAM: Crucial Ballistix DDR4-2666 4GB
* Mainboard: Gigabyte B360N WIFI
* PSU: Kolink SFX-350
* Sorage: Samsung 860 EVO 260GB SSD
* Case: Kolink - Satellite Mini-ITX- / Micro-ATX-Gehäuse - schwarz

For network switches, I'm using two cheap 8-port Netgear Managed Switches which get the job done (they can VLAN so perfect with my OpenSense firewall router).

### Automation

I have a few Raspberry Pis which power the video surveillance and security system, and take care of home automations, like turning on the lights in the morning and so on.

I can probably extend this, but I'm fine with what it does right now.

### Computers

I have two machines, one for gaming and one for working:

* Gaming
  * CPU: Intel(c) I7-7700k
  * Memory: 16GB DDR4-3000
  * GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970
  * Disk(s): 1x 500GB SATA SSD, 1x 3TB SATA HDD, 1x 4TB SATA HDD
* Workstation
  * CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X
  * Memory: 32GB DDR4-2133
  * GPU: 2x Radeon RX 560 OC 4G
  * Disk(s): 1x 500GB NVMe SSD, 1x 500GB SATA SSD

Obviously the gaming computer can always need an upgrade but I am happy with it and the workstation.
You really notice the 8 cores and 16 threads of the AMD Ryzen when compiling code.

### Monitors

I'm currently using 4x LG 29UM68-P 29" 21:9 UltraWide LED monitors, see [LG 29UM68-P 29" product page](http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-29UM68-P-ultrawide-monitor).

A big shoutout to [Ricoo Medientechnik](https://www.ricoo.eu/) for their awesome and not too expensive* monitor stands!

(*In comparsion with around 4 other companies that sell and / or buy monitor stands)

I'm using the following monitor stands from Ricoo:

* 1x [Ricoo Monitor Stand TS3511 Table Mount for 2 Monitors (TS3011)](https://www.ricoo.eu/en/ricoo-pc-screen-led-monitor-stand-ts3511-table-mount-for-2-monitors-monitor-brackets-tft-swivel-arm-monitor-mount-pivoting-monitor-fastener-monitor-rack-monitor-arm-compatible-with-vesa-100x100/a-11189/)
* 2x [Ricoo Desk Monitor Mount Arm (TS3011)](https://www.ricoo.eu/en/ricoo-desk-mount-monitor-ts3011-with-gas-spring-articulation-monitor-bracket-swivelling-tiltable-desk-monitor-stand-pedestal-flat-screen-pc-monitor-tft-display-swivel-arm-desk-led-lcd-desk-holder-brackets-universal-tv-vesa-75x75-100x100/a-10789/)

### Audio

Moving on to the audio equipment, I use the following pieces for audio input and output control:

* [DBX 286 S](https://www.thomann.de/de/dbx_286_s.htm) (Temporarily switched out for [Behringer 802 Xenyx](https://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_xenyx_802.htm))
* [Rode NT1-A Complete Vocal Recording](https://www.thomann.de/de/rode_nt1a_complete_vocal_recording.htm)
* [Numark M 4](https://www.thomann.de/gb/numark_m_4_black.htm) (The link is to the black edition, but I have the grey one. I got it cheap from [Rockshop.de](https://www.rockshop.de/))
* [Akai MPX8](https://www.rockshop.de/akai-mpx8) (Just for the lolz as a soundboard style "player")

To "blast" music at the neighbors I have a very old 5.1 sound system, which sadly has a high level of noise by default. I'll probably replace it soon with a better sound system.

### Chair

A [noblechairs EPIC Gaming Stuhl - schwarz/gold](https://www.caseking.de/noblechairs-epic-gaming-stuhl-schwarz-gold-gagc-038.html) because your arse and back will thank you for it.

Pretty good chair, though if you want to spend more go for a more expensive one with, e.g., "limitless" backrest and more features.

## Finishing touches

To give the whole setup a nice touch, I have added [Philipps Hue LED Lightstrips](https://www.amazon.de/Philips-LightStrip-erweiterbar-Millionen-kompatibel/dp/B0148NMVQA) to the back of the monitors. Though I still have to finally use the "in-built" glue of the light strips to put them on the back of the monitors.

## Result

The result is pretty rad!

<div class="fullwidthimg">
{{< figure src="homeoffice-desktop-setup-shot-2.jpg" width="100%" title="My New Home Setup - With colored background lighting even better!" >}}
</div>

(The LightStrip is hanging down as this was a picture during me gluing it to the monitors with the integrated glue strips)

## Summary

That is my home office setup. It gets the job done and is a dream come true for me.
I have more ideas to exapnd this setup, e.g., making cut outs for the mixer, but I have to see if I'm going that far.

Have Fun!
