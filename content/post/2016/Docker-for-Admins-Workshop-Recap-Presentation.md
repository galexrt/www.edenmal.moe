I created the presentation after I held my Docker for Admins Workshop.
This presentation is just a small recap of the Workshop and as the Workshop is posted on my blog, I'm posting the presentation here too.

If you want to present my slides somewhere, please get in contact with me first. Thanks!

If you like or have any suggestions for the presentation, feel free to leave them in the comments. :)

_P.S. To everyone that already saw the presentation, I changed the design of it, because of the colors used in the first design._
