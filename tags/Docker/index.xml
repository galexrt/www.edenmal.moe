&amp;mdash; Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) 31. Juli 2016 On the Docker GitHub release/changelog page of v1.12.0 under the Runtime section the first point:
Add &amp;ndash;live-restore daemon flag to keep containers running when daemon shuts down, and regain control on startup #23213

The second topic is how to compose containers with docker-compose. The last part is about the container orchestration tool Kubernetes by Google. As part of this you are going to create a Kubernetes cluster and you take a look at the internal services of Kubernetes and deploy applications on top of it.</description></item><item><title>Docker for Admins - Workshop</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2016/Docker-for-Admins-Workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 14:39:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2016/Docker-for-Admins-Workshop/</guid><description>This workshop is deprecated! Please use the new version of the &amp;ldquo;Docker for Admins&amp;rdquo; Workshop post, here.
Goal of the Workshop The Goal is to show how easy it is to use Docker. The simpleness in creating an image for an own project/application. If there&amp;rsquo;s enough time, we also look at how to orchestrate a Kubernetes cluster and let the first containers run on the cluster.
