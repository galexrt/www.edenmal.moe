New table First part of the new home setup, was a new table. The previous was a cheap table from IKEA. The new table is 2.60m long instead of previously only 2.00m. The 0.60m more space is awesome. The desk feels emptier but in a good way, and I have more space for equipment.
If you have the space, go for a big table and keep it clean!</description></item></channel></rss>
