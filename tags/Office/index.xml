Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it.
Table The table is 1.60m (~5.24934 feet) long.
The cable management has been improved in comparsion to my previous setup post. It can still be further improved but it is much better than before and I&amp;rsquo;m finally happy with it now.
Table / Desk Shot Computers Gaming This compliments my &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; Steam library pretty well and the Valve Index headset which is pretty dope to use and play games on.</description></item><item><title>My New Home Office Setup</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2018/My-New-Home-Office-Setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:47:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2018/My-New-Home-Office-Setup/</guid><description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going over my new game and home office setup.
New table First part of the new home setup, was a new table. The previous was a cheap table from IKEA. The new table is 2.60m long instead of previously only 2.00m. The 0.60m more space is awesome. The desk feels emptier but in a good way, and I have more space for equipment.
If you have the space, go for a big table and keep it clean!</description></item></channel></rss>
