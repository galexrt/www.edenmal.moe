This is an update to my old guide which uses the in GitLab 10.3 deprecated Kubernetes integration feature, see: GitLab + Kubernetes: Perfect Match for Continuous Delivery with Container.
NOTE
Please check the requirements before beginning.
Requirements Kubernetes Cluster GitLab instance GitLab Container Registry enabled. GitLab CI runner configured and enabled. The CI runners must be able to access the Kubernetes apiserver.</description></item><item><title>Container and Kubernetes Training</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2019/Container-and-Kubernetes-Training/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 22:20:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2019/Container-and-Kubernetes-Training/</guid><description>Welcome!

Currently it is very very far from optimal to run CRI-O on a &amp;ldquo;no package manager&amp;rdquo; system like Container Linux. For curious people, this should work &amp;ldquo;perfectly&amp;rdquo; though.
NOTE
If it is not clear from the above WARNING, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend this for production (yet). Personally I will soon replace Docker with CRI-O in my private Kubernetes cluster though, because Docker causes issues in my cluster.
This post is showing how you can install and run CRI-O for Kubernetes on Container Linux (previously CoreOS).</description></item><item><title>KubeCon 2017 Austin</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/KubeCon-2017-Austin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 12:09:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/KubeCon-2017-Austin/</guid><description>NOTE All credit for the slides in the pictures goes to their creators!

Clarification Thanks to Baju Judiantara for his comment! He correctly found that the title is contradict to the IPXE boot script in Step 4 - Add grub config for iPXE boot. To resolve the conratdict of the title with the post I have added a snippet which does the interface configuration manual and not over DHCP.</description></item><item><title>GitLab + Kubernetes: Running CI Runners in Kubernetes</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/GitLab-Kubernetes-Running-CI-Runners-in-Kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 09:30:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/GitLab-Kubernetes-Running-CI-Runners-in-Kubernetes/</guid><description>Intro In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over using GitLab CI to create your application&amp;rsquo;s container Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes.

Kubernetes service integration has been deprecated in GitLab 10.3. If the service is active the cluster information still be editable, however we advised to disable and reconfigure the clusters using the new Clusters page. If the service is inactive the fields will be uneditable. Read GitLab 10.3 release post for more information. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/kubernetes.html.
Instead of the integration, the new GitLab CI Kubernetes Cluster feature should be used, the documentation for that can be found here: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>Container Linux: Specification YAML</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Container-Linux-Specification-YAML/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 16:14:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Container-Linux-Specification-YAML/</guid><description>I checked the Container Linux configuration page and found the config specification here: https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/configuration.html (link refers to the latest version, the current version can be seen in the below field).

NOTE I wrote the next few sentences while not having internet connection because of &amp;ldquo;DeutscheBahn&amp;rdquo; ;)
A thing I just have to note is that I had taken an IC instead of an ICE to Munich. Now guess what, ICs don&amp;rsquo;t have wifi.. I personally think that in a county as advanced as Germany, it should be &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; to have wifi on &amp;ldquo;every&amp;rdquo; train.</description></item><item><title>Container Days 2017 Hamburg</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Container-Days-2017-Hamburg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:23:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Container-Days-2017-Hamburg/</guid><description>Thanks!
