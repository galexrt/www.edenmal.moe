Intro The Vagrant VirtualBox provider can&amp;rsquo;t start VMs in parallel (--parallel flag for vagrant up). It is possible to do so, but you need to &amp;ldquo;invest&amp;rdquo; in Vagrantfile and Makefile.
Solution Use Makefile to run NODE=X vagrant up, where NODE=X is the &amp;ldquo;number&amp;rdquo; of the node you want to be started.

Currently it is very very far from optimal to run CRI-O on a &amp;ldquo;no package manager&amp;rdquo; system like Container Linux. For curious people, this should work &amp;ldquo;perfectly&amp;rdquo; though.
NOTE
If it is not clear from the above WARNING, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend this for production (yet). Personally I will soon replace Docker with CRI-O in my private Kubernetes cluster though, because Docker causes issues in my cluster.
This post is showing how you can install and run CRI-O for Kubernetes on Container Linux (previously CoreOS).</description></item><item><title>KubeCon 2017 Austin</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/KubeCon-2017-Austin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 12:09:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/KubeCon-2017-Austin/</guid><description>NOTE All credit for the slides in the pictures goes to their creators!

Kubernetes service integration has been deprecated in GitLab 10.3. If the service is active the cluster information still be editable, however we advised to disable and reconfigure the clusters using the new Clusters page. If the service is inactive the fields will be uneditable. Read GitLab 10.3 release post for more information. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/kubernetes.html.
Instead of the integration, the new GitLab CI Kubernetes Cluster feature should be used, the documentation for that can be found here: https://docs.</description></item><item><title>Google Cloud: Enterprise Grade Hybrid Cloud with Kubernetes Cluster Federation</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Google-Cloud-Enterprise-Grade-Hybrid-Cloud-with-Kubernetes-Cluster-Federation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:14:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Google-Cloud-Enterprise-Grade-Hybrid-Cloud-with-Kubernetes-Cluster-Federation/</guid><description>Intro I went to the Google Cloud Event about &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Grade Hybrid Cloud with Kubernetes Cluster Federation&amp;rdquo; at Google Munich.

A thing I just have to note is that I had taken an IC instead of an ICE to Munich. Now guess what, ICs don&amp;rsquo;t have wifi..

So a big thanks to them for creating the project, as also the code is almost completely based on their operator code.
The project can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/galexrt/elasticsearch-operator.
Installation Use the bundle.yaml that is in the repo root, to run the operator on the cluster.
kubectl create -f bundle.yaml Verify the installation of the ThirdPartyResources To verify that the operator has successful installed its ThirdPartyResources, you simply check the Kubernetes server for them:</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v3 Presentation</title><link>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Kubernetes-v3-Presentation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2017 13:33:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://edenmal.moe/post/2017/Kubernetes-v3-Presentation/</guid><description>This is an updated version of my Kubernetes v2 presentation.
